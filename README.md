# Data Log Cleaning & Timeline Analysis

This repository contains a structured data-processing setup with two Python pipelines and two Streamlit applications, designed for cleaning user event logs and analysing user behaviour over time.

---

## Python Pipelines

### 1. `pipeline_deduplication.py`

Cleans raw event log data by removing millisecond-level duplicate events generated by the same user for the same event type. The earliest event is retained as the canonical record. This pipeline produces a single source of truth for cleaned event data.

**Output folder:** `pipeline_deduplication/`

* `cleaned_events.csv` – deduplicated canonical events
* `repetition_summary.csv` – summary of removed duplicate bursts
* `unique_users_list.csv` – list of unique users
* Per-user cleaned event files

---

### 2. `pipeline_time_sequence.py`

Builds on the cleaned data from the deduplication pipeline and orders events strictly by timestamp to preserve the true sequence of user actions. This pipeline is optimised for behavioural and journey analysis.

**Output folder:** `pipeline_time_sequence/`

* `cleaned_events_chronological.csv` – time-ordered user events
* `repetition_summary.csv` – repetition audit in a time-sequenced context
* `unique_users_list.csv` – list of unique users
* Per-user timeline files

## Streamlit Applications

### Event & Audit Dashboard

Link: [https://datalog.streamlit.app/](https://datalog.streamlit.app/)

This application provides a read-only interface to explore cleaned, deduplicated events. Users can select a user ID and event type to inspect event data and review which duplicate events were removed during cleaning.

---

### User Event Timeline Explorer

Link: [https://timeline-log.streamlit.app/](https://timeline-log.streamlit.app/)

This application focuses on time-ordered user behaviour. It allows users to view the exact sequence of events performed by a user over time, supporting journey and behavioural analysis.

## Notes

* Pipelines are executed offline and their outputs are committed to the repository.
* Streamlit applications are read-only and consume precomputed CSV outputs.
